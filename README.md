# Movie-Data-Base-With-PHP
For this project I am going to create a basic website based on a topic of my
choosing (in this case itâ€™s a movie databse like IMDB) with html, css, js and php.
The website consists of:
1. Home page: Basic info about the newest added movies.
2. Movies list: A page with a list of all the movies available to track.
3. Movie info: Information about a selected movie.
4. Login: A login modal for the user to sign in into their account.
5. Register: A register modal for the user to register an account.
6. User page: Info about the user. The user should be able to change this info.
7. Admin page: Where users (with the role admin) can add new movies to the site
